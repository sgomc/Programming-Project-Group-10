-ABOUT-

The VAST Map Project is a project designed to give easy access flight data all around the USA so you can arrange or analyse a flight. Our team of five, Veronika, Maccolins, Amy, Stephen, Thomas, have worked together to design 
a project that is accessible, smooth and dynamic, with many features to provide ease of access, such as an interactable map and a statistics page.

Our team has worked hard to make sure the project is as "Vast" as possible. The roles that we took during the project are as follows:

Veronika Zavatska (Project Manager)
Led the overall project and handled core development including the flight menu system, airport displays, UI enhancements, and data optimization.

Maccolins Obijiaku
Developed data visualization through histograms in statistics page and created the project's introduction section.

Amy Murray
Implemented filtering functionality, scroll features, UI improvements, and a special option for tracking delayed flights.

Stephen Conboy
Provided geographical elements including the U.S. map, airport location data, and the flight path simulation feature.

Thomas Kennedy
Created state selection buttons, developed the flexible date search functionality, performed optimization work, and managed the about page.


We hope that you get as much out of the VAST Map as we've had designing it. We sincerely thank you for giving the project a try.
