The idea - first screen: map of the U.S., the user can select the state (highlighting the button).
When the user clicks on the state, there is a list of airports pops out on the right, sorted by more active airport goes first (with more flights).
The user can select the specific airport or they can search for the specific flight.

When we click on the airport, we have a window with tabs, the first shown tab is departures, the second tab that can be selected is arrivals.

Things that we have to do:
+get the menu
+separate data for each state
+find the clear U.S map to put the state names there
+connect the menu to the state (state is a buton with a name)  (data)
+create the tabs and window for the airport selected
+create buttons for each state
+stats
