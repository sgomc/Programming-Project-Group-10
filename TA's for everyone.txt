The idea - first screen: map of the U.S., the user can select the state (highlighting the button).
When the user clicks on the state, there is a list of airports pops out on the right, sorted by more active airport goes first (with more flights).
The user can select the specific airport or they can search for the specific flight.

When we click on the airport, we have a window with tabs, the first shown tab is departures, the second tab that can be selected is arrivals.

Things that we have to do:

MacColins + class statistics (histogram)
          + intro

Veronika + get the menu for flights int the state
         + create the tabs and window for the airport selected (departures and arrivals)
         + connect the menu to the state (state is a buton with a name)  (data)
         + A bit more colour to the project, colour the windows
         + colour the map regarding the amount of airports in state
         + Add something to main menu
         + Optimization with data loading

Amy      + filter by dates, lateness, and allow the user to input a flight number and implement a scroll down button to see more of the flights
         + More user friendly interface
         + Show only delayed flights with radio button


Stephen  + find the clear U.S. map
         + list all the airports 
         + find their coordinates in Processing 
         =  Add the plane which will fly to the selected location (Stephen proposed idea before) -> select the flight from departures arrivals, click on it, then the windows          close to show the simulation, and then they open again at the point they were before.

Tommy    + create buttons for each state
         + Search for date, 22/01/2022, 22 January
